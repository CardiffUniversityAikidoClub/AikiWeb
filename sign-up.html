            <h2>How to sign up</h2>
            <p>Registration for club membership and Athletic Union affiliation can be done online, via the Students Union website. 
                Alternatively, you can pay in person at the Athletic Union offices in the Students Union building on Senghenydd Road, 
                Cardiff.
            </p>
            <p>You will need to pay the Cardiff University Athletic Union to affiliate with them. For Cardiff University students it 
                costs £20 for the entire year. We don't control this fee and it is the same no matter which sports club you choose to 
                join.
            </p>
            <p>
                The 2020/21 fees for Cardiff University Aikido Club are as follows:
            </p>
            <ul>

                <li>British Aikido Board Membership - <b>INCLUDED</b></li>

                <li>Per Class Mat Fees - <b>FREE</b></li>
                <li>Grading Fees - <b>FREE</b></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Cardiff University Students can also train at our associate club, Fudoshin Aikido Cardiff, on Mondays, 19:00 - 21:00
                at Chapter Arts Centre, for FREE, as part of your membership.
            </p>
            <p>
                The only additional costs to students are to attend weekend seminars and courses, as detailed on our Events page. 
                However, these are heavily subsidised by the Fudoshin Aikido Association, with discounted rates for students.

            <h2>What if I don't study at Cardiff University?</h2>
            <p>While the club is run by and primarily for students at Cardiff University, it is still possible for us to accept other 
                members. For example: If you are a member of staff at Cardiff University or a student at another university you can still join, 
                but you will have to pay an additional affiliate fee to the Athletic Union.
            </p>
            <p>It is best to speak to a committee officer before you sign up, as we have to inform the Athletic Union before any non 
                Cardiff University students join the club.</p>
