            <h2>About Aikido</h2>
            <p>
                Literally translated as “the way of harmony”, Aikido is a Japanese martial art created by Morihei 
                Ueshiba (1883-1969), often referred to as 'O Sensei'. It has its origins in the many different styles 
                of ancient Bujutsu studied by the founder in the years before 1939, and his spiritual awakening in mid-life.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ueshiba’s work refined martial techniques - of which he was an acknowledged master - into his unique art, 
                insisting that Budo is not a way to make war but, on the contrary, a way to end conflict. Aikido is a true 
                Budo because of its moral and ethical imperatives and because, at its most profound level, the aim of the 
                practitioner is mastery of the ego and the creation of a non-contentious spirit.
            </p>
            <p>
                Even within the physical realm, what matters might not be what you would expect. It’s very nice to be young, 
                strong, fit and agile, but you don’t need to be any of these things to practise Aikido or to be good at it.
            </p>
            <p>
                You’ll find, for example, that in Aikido posture is more important than strength, and timing more important 
                than speed, and these are the attributes you will develop through your practice.
            </p>
            <p>
                Really, the only way to discover what Aikido is about and gain an insight into this fascinating martial art 
                is to try it for yourself.

                Europe. You can find out more about these seminars on our Events page.

                experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                You will be given expert instruction from your first class, and encouraged to practice aikido within your own 
                safe limits and at a pace that is comfortable to you.
